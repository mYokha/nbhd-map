# Pubs around Anfield

#### Short story
>Assume you're a huge LFC fan but you are not a local guy.
Obviously, if you're in the town and you're about to watch the game you want to have a pint of beer.
Where can you do that? Easy. This app will show you all the places in radius of like 3km from the stadium.

## How to use the app
What is really great about the app is that it's fully client-sided so there's no need to set up a `localhost`.
1. All you need to do is to use `git clone` in your Git bush or press "Clone or download" and then "Download ZIP". That's the way you get files on your machine.
2. On your computer locate to the folder where the app's files were downloaded.
3. Run `index.html` in your favorite browser.
