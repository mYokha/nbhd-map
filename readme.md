# Pubs around Anfield

>Assume you're a huge LFC fan but you are not a local guy.
Obviously, if you're in the town and you're about to watch the game you want to have a pint of beer.
Where can you do that? Easy. This app will show you all the places in radius of like 3km from the stadium.


## How to use the app

### Mobile users first
>The app is fully responsive and mobile friendly.

What mobile users need to know:
- When you open an app you can see a map with markers of pubs.
- To see the list of pubs click the input field
- To filter the pubs start typing
- When you hit the chosen pub it's name will be set as a default value of the input field
- Attention! The list is hiding after you chose the item so you can the full map. If you put cursor into the input field again the list will appear. This is by design!

What desktop users need to know:
- Usage is very similar
- The list of pubs appears on the left side of the window
- Markers and pubs in the list filter as you are typing... cool ha? :)

What every user needs to know:
- This app uses Foursquare API to load the information about every single location
- Foursquare information appears in the marker's infowindow
- This app is pretty simple but the author sruggled sometimes writhing it... Just so you know.
